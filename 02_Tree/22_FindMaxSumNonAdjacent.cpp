/*
Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint that no two chosen node in subset should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our sum then we canâ€™t take its any children or parents in consideration and vice versa.

                                               

Example 1:

Input:
     11
    /  \
   1    2
Output: 11
Explanation: The maximum sum is sum of
node 11.
Example 2:

Input:
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    /     /  \
   4     5    6
Output: 16
Explanation: The maximum sum is sum of
nodes 1 4 5 6 , i.e 16. These nodes are
non adjacent.
